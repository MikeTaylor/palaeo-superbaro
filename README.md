This respository contains work on an in-progress paper that will redescribe the giant cervical vertebra BYU 9024, currently assigned to _Supersaurus_, and show how it closely resembles the cervicals of _Barosaurus_.
**Spoiler alert!** Much of this will be be based on [our 2016 SVPCA presentation, _How big did Barosaurus get?_](http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2016/abstract.html)

Interesting part of this respository:
* [In-progress manuscript](TaylorWedel-giant-barosaurus.docx)
* [Illustrations -- masters](figures)
* [Illustrations -- exported and viewable](figures/export)
* [Source images used in illustrations](figures/sources)

I've written other open-process papers ([the Archbishop description](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-archbishop/), [the vertebral orientation paper](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-vo/)) in Markdown, so that they appear formatted on GitHub ([example](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-vo/blob/master/vo-manuscript.md)). But that raises a collaboration barrier, so we'll do this one in LibreOffice.
