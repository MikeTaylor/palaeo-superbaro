This respository contains work on an in-progress paper that will describe the "three Baro jacket" (3BJ) at BYU, and redescribe the giant cervical vertebra currently assigned to _Supersaurus_, and show how they closely resemble the cervicals of _Barosaurus_.
**Spoiler alert!** Much of this will be be based on [our 2016 SVPCA presentation, _How big did Barosaurus get?_](http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2016/abstract.html)

The 3BJ specimen is BYU 20815. It is from field jacket 3GR, and was excavated in 1966 from the BYU Locality 601, the Jensen/Jensen quarry. The accession number (which I didn't realise was different from the specimen number) is JJ/66. The giant cervical assigned to _Supersaurus_ is of course BYU 9024.

Interesting parts of this respository:
* [In-progress manuscript](TaylorWedel-giant-barosaurus.docx)
* [Illustrations -- masters](figures)
* [Illustrations -- exported and viewable](figures/export)
* [Source images used in illustrations](figures/sources)
* [Documentation of permission to cite pers. comms.](permissions) (OK, this one is not interesting, but I guess it's necessary)
