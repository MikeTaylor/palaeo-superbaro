This respository contains work on an in-progress paper that will redescribe the giant cervical vertebra BYU 9024, currently assigned to _Supersaurus_, and show how it closely resembles the cervicals of _Barosaurus_.
**Spoiler alert!** Much of this will be be based on [our 2016 SVPCA presentation, _How big did Barosaurus get?_](http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2016/abstract.html)

Interesting part of this respository:
* [In-progress manuscript](TaylorWedel-giant-barosaurus.docx)
* [Illustrations -- masters](figures)
* [Illustrations -- exported and viewable](figures/export)
* [Source images used in illustrations](figures/sources)
* [Documentation about the AMNH's 1990 rearing _Barosaurus_ mount](amnh-mount)
* [Documentation of permission to cite pers. comms.](permissions) (OK, this one is not interesting, but I guess it's necessary)

Anyone is welcome to [file issues](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-superbaro/issues).

**Note to self.**
We made a start on this project before. The directory is called `jjb` and it's in the `mike-matt` shared Dropbox folder. It needs to be merged into the current project.
