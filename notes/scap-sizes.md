The complete right scapulocoracoid of _Barosaurus_ AMNH 6341 measures 1300 along the curve or 1240 in a straight line (McIntosh 2006:59:table 2.6). The lengths of the scapulae of the BYU _Supersaurus_ are the subject of some uncertainty, but Jensen (1985:701) gives the lengths of holotype BYU 9025 (BYU 5500 of his usage)  as 2.44 m and the referred BYU 12962 (BYU 5501 of his usage) as 2.70 m. These measurements are probably analogous to the along-the-curve measurements, as the scapulae were found flattened. On this basis, the _Supersaurus_ scapulocoracoids were 1.88 and 2.08 times as long as that of the AMNH _Barosaurus_, for an average of 1.98 times as long. This is consonant with an animal twice the size of the AMNH _Barosaurus_, as suggested by the relative size of BYU 9024 and C9 of the AMNH specimen.

XXX Or does McIntosh's measurement refer to the scap alone, rather than to the fused scapulocoracoid? Perhaps so given that Hatcher (1901:44) gives a length of 1.6 m for the fused scapulocoracoid of _Diplodocus_ CM 84.
