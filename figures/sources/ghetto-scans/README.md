"Notes on juvenile Barosaurus and Barodocus.pdf" was sent by Matt on 4th March 2022, with the following message:

Hey, not long after telling you I was busy all day, I am going to make you happy. See attached. Back when Dan Ksepka and I were first thinking about writing up "Barodocus", I sent him scans of my notebook pages. I forgot all about those until this morning, when I found them in my Gmail archive.

A guide to what's going on in the attached file:
* First spread, left page, top: that's just a short note about another specimen that is otherwise not discussed or sketched in the attached pages.
* The table on that page is just my transcription of the AMNH 6341 measurements from McIntosh (2005)
* First spread, right page: this is what you want, my measurements of AMNH 7535, the juvenile Baro (or are they) cervicals we've been discussing. As you can see from my notes, the specimen was catalogued as Diplodocus when I saw it. Abbreviations: 
  * ACH/ACW - anterior centrum (condyle) height/width
  * PCH/PCW - posterior centrum (cotyle) height/width
  * CL/FL - centrum length/functional length (without condyle)
  * TL/TH - total length/height
* Second spread: sketches of C2-C5 of AMNH 7535. "Upstairs specimen" is to distinguish from the exhibit specimen; the latter is now AMNH 7530
* Third spread: max depth of the pneumatic fossae/camerae in AMNH 7535, measured from the rim of the cavity. In lieu of CT scanning, that was my attempt to get at the asymmetry of the median septum.
* Fourth and fifth spreads: my sketches of AMNH 7530, the probable Kaatedocus series that was at that time on exhibit downstairs.

Stray thoughts: 
1. It would be cool to include the fossa depth measurements when we publish, not least to maybe inspire other people to start documenting that information.
2. Speaking of, and in part because I'm looking forward to going to Toronto to measure the H. delfsi verts, maybe it would be useful, for us and for others, to come up with a standard vertebra measurement list or even a sheet that people could print off copies of. I'll give this some thought.

Oh, I heard back from Garth Dallman at RCI. They have a lot of prep work to do, including physically cutting off the old armature, so he said the best time to visit would be in the summer. So no tearing rush there. I will keep you posted on how that develops, in case you want to join me for a little Haplopocalypse.

Gotta run, but hopefully this is helpful.

Best,

Matt
