Hi, Scott, I hope all is well.

I'm working with Matt Wedel on a paper where we will briefly compare
the size and proportions of Barosaurus lentus AMNH 6341 and Diplodocus
carnegii CM 84. If we may, we'd love to your skeletal reconstructions
to illustrate this comparison, as I sneakily did in slide 8 of this
deck that I used for my SVPCA 2016 talk:
http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2016/TaylorWedel2016-how-big-did-barosaurus-get.pdf

As always this would be destined for a CC By journal, which I realise
is asking a lot of someone who draws for a living. But heck, you've
been kind to us before (Figure 1 at
https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app56/app20100073.pdf ) so I
figured I might as well be cheeky and ask :-)

Thanks,

-- Mike.

Hi Mike,

Oh sure, you just want to use my drawings to besmirch my beloved Supersaurus! I'm just kidding, that's fine. I've recently updated all my sauropod skeletals in the eponymous skeletal gallery on my website - did you want the current versions or would you prefer the versions you used in the slides?

Thanks, Scott! Current versions, of course — there's nothing magical
about a slide that I made six years ago (where did THAT time go?!), so
I'll use the best available versions. Can I please have them in your
best resolution?

To jump to the punchline (in case you didn't already get there), we
think BYU 9024, the giant cervical referred to Supersaurus, is really
from a super-giant Barosaurus — or at least is morphologically
indistinguishable from one.

-- Mike.

Here you are Mike. I've known for a while your take on BYU 9024 - you weren't really circumspect about it! I have to admit that as unlikely as it seems superficially, there's at least a chance that the WDC specimen really is the same thing, and maybe Barosaurus just gets big and a bit more robust if it is lucky enough to keep aging. But that's probably a discussion that can really only be had with another trip back there, or digging up a LOT of older photographs.

Anyhow, good luck on the publication!

-Scott
