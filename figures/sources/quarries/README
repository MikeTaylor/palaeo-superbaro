	So when it comes to maps for Dry Mesa, it is spotty in the
	early years.  What few maps that Jim Jensen made (1972 and
	1979) are incomplete.  But, based on photos and coordinates,
	Rod Horrocks was able to decipher where in the quarry area the
	yearly excavations occurred even though maps were not made
	some years (see attached map).
	
	There are pretty good maps for the 12 years it was worked from
	1986 through 1999.  (2 years in that time frame it was not
	worked).
