Hi, Brooks, hope all is well.

Matt and I are just back from SVPCA -- that's the UK's closest
equivalent to the SVP meeting, though much smaller: the Symposium on
Vertebrate Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy. Our talk on the
Jensen/Jensen Barosaurus jacket went down well, and with your
permissing, we would now like to go ahead and describe that material.
Is that OK with you?

If so, I would like to ask you for two things, if I may: first, an
accession number for that specimen. And second, if you're able to find
it, the original digital photograph from which the bit of paper with
the specimen was printed: you know, the one that we concluded was the
other side of the jacket.

Many thanks,

-- Mike.

Mike

Glad to hear the talk went well.  Sure, go ahead and describe the
material.

Photos I took in the lab after the first side was prepared are
attached.  Sorry the lighting and resolution is not great - I just
shot them for a lab record before the block was flipped.

Rod will assign a specimen number shortly.
