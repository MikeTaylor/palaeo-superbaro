Hi Mike,

Garth and I had a look through some old boxes and came up with a copy of Jack’s Barosaurus manuscript. In the attached photo you can see a note on the side which indicates for cervicals 1-7 we scaled up from AMNH 7535 a Barosaurus juvenile from Howe Quarry.

 

We mounted the original cervicals of AMNH 7535 for the opening of the Barosaurus exhibit, they were in their own case on a brass support structure designed by Applebaum. I don’t think the display was up for long, the brass structure proved unstable and it was removed from exhibit

Cheers,

Peter

Thanks, Garth; and hello, Peter!

 

Now I am really fascinated -- because AMNH 6341 only preserves cervicals 8-16 (or 7-15 as they were thought to be before McIntosh's 2005 revision). And given how influential that amazing mount has been(*) in the popular understanding of Barosaurus, much rests on how the anterior seven (or six) cervicals were restored. Do you have any documentation on that? Or, failing that, personal recollections?

 

Many thanks!

 

-- Mike

 

 

 

(*) Seriously, I'm not flattering when I call it "amazing". It's just about the most sensational single object I have ever seen. Only the Berlin brachiosaur rivals it.

Yes, we did the AMNH one as well. That was the first ever Barosaurus mount however this mount was before my time at RCI.  My understanding, and Peter can correct me on this, but it was all AMNH material. Barosaurus and Diplodocus to fill in.

Excellent! I have picked up the impression that that mount contains no original fossil material in the neck, nor casts made directly from fossils held by the Utah NHM -- but that the neck was copied from the ROM mount, which would mean that it has lots of Carnegie Diplodocus cervicals. Are you able to confirm or correct that?

 

Thanks again,

Hi, Garth, thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I am a bit ashamed that I didn't recognise the Carnegie Diplodocus cervicals when I was at the ROM, but now looking at my photos it checks out.

 

Would it be OK to cite this as a personal communication?

 

Thanks again,

Hello Dr. Taylor,

Yes,  we prepared and mounted the ROM 3670 Barosaurus. This mount was under the gun time wise and we had just moved our facility so there was a great deal going on at that time. I've been checking for working spreadsheets and examining mounting pictures of the cervical section. Your summation of the cervicals looks to be correct. You can tell the fossil vertebral specimens when viewing the mount as they will have armature supports running up the side of them. 

I haven't found complete information yet on the mount in our database. Peter may have something in his personal files and if he has more information he will follow up. 

We used the Carnegie Diplodocus molds from Dinolab to fill in the missing elements. 

We'll follow up as more information comes to light.

Best,

Subject: Composition of ROM Barosaurus Moun

 

Dear RCI,

 

Together with Matt Wedel (who you know from your work in creating casts of Sauroposeidon), I am working on a paper about cervical vertebrae of Barosaurus.

 

In this connection I've been in contact with David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum regarding the cervical material in the skeletal mount of ROM 3670 which you prepared in (I think) 2007.

 

Do you have records showing exactly what the composition of that mount was? Matt and I would find it useful to know exactly which cervical vertebrae are ROM fossils, and how the remaining cervicals were filled in. Signage in the public gallery suggests that three and a bit cervicals may be real, and that they are perhaps 16, 13, 12 and the back of 11, but I would rather know from a more concrete source. And would I be right in guessing that the missing vertebrae were copied from the AMNH mount?

 

Many thanks,
